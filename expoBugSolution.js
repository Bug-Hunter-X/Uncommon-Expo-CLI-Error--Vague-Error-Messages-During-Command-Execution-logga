Debugging this vague Expo CLI error requires a systematic approach. There's no single solution, as the cause could vary. 

**1. Check for Network Issues:** Ensure stable internet connectivity using appropriate network diagnostics.

**2. Clean Project Dependencies:**
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```
If using yarn:
```bash
yarn cache clean
yarn install
```

**3. Clear Expo Cache:**
```bash
expo start --clear
```

**4. Verify Expo CLI Version and Update:**
```bash
expo -v  // Check version
npm install -g expo-cli@latest // Update to the latest version
```

**5. Examine the Log Files (System Specific):** Search for error logs or console messages which may provide more details.

**6. Investigate Dependency Conflicts:** Check your `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for conflicting dependency versions.  Resolve the conflicts using techniques provided by your package manager (npm or yarn).

**7. Consider a Project Reset (Last Resort):**  If the issue persists, create a fresh new Expo project, copying over only essential code and assets. This helps isolate whether the issue is in your project or the Expo environment.
