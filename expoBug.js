This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project. The error message is not very descriptive, often simply stating that there's been an error during the execution of a command, without giving specific details about the cause or location of the problem. This makes debugging difficult.  The error might manifest during various CLI operations, such as starting the development server (`expo start`), building the app (`expo build`), or running other commands. It might be linked to underlying issues like network problems, corrupted project files, or conflicts between Expo CLI versions and other dependencies.
